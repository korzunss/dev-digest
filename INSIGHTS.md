# Insights — repo-wide

An append-only log of things that cost someone time. Package-local findings go in
that package's `INSIGHTS.md`; this file is for what crosses package boundaries —
two or more packages, the `shared` contracts, `scripts/`, Docker, CI.

**How to use it.** Write an entry when a symptom took more than a few minutes to
explain — especially when the code looks correct and behaves otherwise. The
`engineering-insights` skill routes a finding to the right file, picks the
section, and enforces the quality gate; run it at the end of a task, or write the
entry by hand in the same format.

**Sections.** Every `INSIGHTS.md` in this repo carries the same seven, in the same
order. Entries go newest-first **within** their section.

| Section | What belongs there |
|---|---|
| What Works | An approach that succeeded and should be reused here |
| What Doesn't Work | A dead end or antipattern — the most valuable section |
| Codebase Patterns | A convention or architectural decision, with the reason |
| Tool & Library Notes | A quirk of a dependency, CLI, or the local toolchain |
| Recurring Errors & Fixes | A symptom that will be seen again, and its fix |
| Session Notes | Dated wrap-up: what changed and what it taught |
| Open Questions | Left unresolved, phrased so someone can pick it up |

**Entry format.**

```md
### YYYY-MM-DD — short title in the imperative or as a symptom
**Symptom:** what you actually observed.
**Cause:** why it happened.
**Rule:** what to do from now on. Omit if there's nothing to generalize.
**Evidence:** `path/to/file.ts:42` · command · error string
```

**Append-only.** Never rewrite or delete an entry. An entry that has gone stale
gets a new, dated correction naming what changed.

**Promotion.** When an entry hardens into a standing rule, promote a **one-line**
version into the `Gotchas` section of the relevant `CLAUDE.md` and leave the full
write-up here. That keeps `CLAUDE.md` short without losing the reasoning.

## Codebase Patterns

### 2026-09-17 — searches return duplicate hits from `server/clones/`

**Symptom:** grep and file searches surface two or three copies of the same
file, some of them stale.
**Cause:** `server/clones/` holds checkouts of every imported repo, and one of
the imported repos is DevDigest itself — so the tree contains full copies of this
codebase.
**Rule:** exclude `server/clones/**` from every search. Never edit a file under
that path; it's runtime data, and the next resync overwrites it.
**Evidence:** `CLAUDE.md` → "Do not touch"; `.gitignore` → `clones/`
